# SPA Dash

A simple single page application containing a dashboard for users to view and upload verifiable documents. Users, either managed or personal, will be able to access and use the dashboard.

## Prerequisities

Ensure that these tools are available and configured correctly in your device before moving on.\
For this application, Node and Yarn is used.

The version used is as below: -

- Node: v22.6.0
- Yarn: v1.22.22

**Note: Varying versions may cause incompatibility**

## Getting Started

Before running any of the scripts below, be sure to perform the following command:

`yarn install`

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

**Note: Two test suites are available.**

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
